# tt-crud

See the [component page](http://tt-components.github.io/tt-crud) for more information.

## Getting Started

We've put together a [guide for tt-crud](http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/reusableelements.html) to help get you rolling.

## Brief Overview


## Develop and Test
```
$ cd ..  # You'll want to run the web server from the parent directory.
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
This starts a web server on port 8000, so you can test your new element by navigating a browser to the URL localhost:8000/tt-crud/demo.html.



# Install Env
npm install --global gulp
